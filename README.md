# venn streamlit
This is a small streamlit app to produce venn diagrams for 2-4 lists. 
You can choose number of lists, name the lists and you can also get the result of the intersection between lists. 

Part of the code for creating venn plots is taken and adapted from Xiaoyong Pan's DislncRF-venn.py
